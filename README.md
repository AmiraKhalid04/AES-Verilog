# Advanced Encryption Standard ðŸ”‘
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) offering:
- Encryption & Decryption: Securely encrypts and decrypts data.
- Configurable Key Size: Adapts to your security needs (128, 192, or 256 bits).

## Getting Started
Clone the Repository First 

**For Simulation:**
- Simulate the design using a **ModelSim**
(image of simulation to be added)

**For FPGA Implementation:**
- Integrate the code into **Quartus** for deployment on Intel FPGAs.

## Video (to be added)
- The last 2 bytes at each round during both encryption and decryption are displayed on the 7 segment
- When input text is encrypted and decrypted successfully the led turns on
